           Greeting my review team we have a blogger by the name
           of <%= @content.user.vname %> who is building some
           new blogs to help advertise his content on this site.
           So I gathered you all together to have a look at his
           newest submission to see if it fits within our
           guidlines. This blog might contain some artwork ads
           and as such I like you to look them over in addition
           to the traditional text based content that blogs
           normally contain. Be sure to check to see if this
           content does indeed fit the book group that it has
           been assigned to. Please give this content an in
           depth check as we want to ensure this community stays
           safe for everyone.
        <% end %>
     </p>

        <% if @type == "Blog" %>
           Now I am sure all of you are itching to get started
           so I setup a useful url <%= @url %> for you to use.
           However if you are having trouble finding this url,
           well I created a special panel for you guys to use
           when it comes to reviewing content. This special
           panel should only be used when you need it and
           turned off when you don't. Its very important that
           you keep this special knowledge under lock and key
           as we don't want this tool to be abused for evil
           means. Now if you approve the blog then the user
           gets points or has them removed from their account.
           If you deny the content please get in touch with
           the user and let him know why and how to go about
           fixing it if it doesn't fit our guidelines. I
           leave that ruling up to you.
