           Our review team has taken the time to do look over
           the blog you submited to our site and found
           that it fits into the correct book group. The
           images if any that this blog contains appear
           to be operating within normal parameters.
           Depending on wether or not this blog is running
           with ads we have taken the liberty of removing
           or adding points to your points account. Blogs
           are a good place to advertise your artwork,
           pets, movies, or sounds. In recognition
           of your effort we had decided to add these 
           <%= points %> points to your account.
        <% end %>
