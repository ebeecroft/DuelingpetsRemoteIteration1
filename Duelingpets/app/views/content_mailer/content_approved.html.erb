      <p>
         Our review team has taken the time to do look over
         the <%= @type.downcase %> you submited to our site and found
         that it fits into the correct book group. The
         <% if @type == "Blog" %>
            images if any that this blog contains appear
            to be operating within normal parameters.
            Depending on wether or not this blog is running
            with ads we have taken the liberty of removing
            or adding points to your points account. Blogs
            are a good place to advertise your artwork,
            pets, movies, or sounds.
         <% elsif @type == "OC" %>
            oc itself has a lot of interesting looking features,
            the background tunes are well out of this world. The
            voice is really well done and reflects the feel of
            the character itself. The image of the character
            itself looks really cool and looks like you put in a
            lot of effort in its design.
         <% end %>
         In recognition of your effort we have decided
         to add these <%= @points %> points to your account.
